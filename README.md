A bot made in the discord.py rewrite.

## What even is gladward?
Gladward is an open source bot made by Zeexel in the discord.py rewrite. While it's not completely done, there's still many things to play around with at the moment.


## Why the hell should I put this piece of crap in my server?
Why not? It may not be the best bot, but it's still a bot.

You need the discord.py rewrite, which can be downloaded here:

### Reminder:
Please don't contact me for issues regarding discord.py, that should be taken to the discord.py server, which has support for both the rewrite and the asyncio (0.16.x) versions.
