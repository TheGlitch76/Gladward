!!! Might as well warn you now, this is a pretty vulgar bot in some cases. Especially the 8-ball !!!

# Gladward Version 1
A bot made in the discord.py rewrite.

## What even is Gladward?
Gladward is an open source bot made by Zeexel in the discord.py rewrite. While it's not completely done, there's still many things to play around with at the moment.


## Why the hell should I put this piece of crap in my server?
Why not? It may not be the best bot, but it's still a bot.

## What kinda features are planned to come in the near future?

### Lockdown
Locks all channels down in case of a raid and prevents new users from joining until the lockdown is disabled.
### Logging
Logs certain actions based on the user's specifications.
### User-Suggested features.
Features that users suggest in the support discord.

# Things you should probably know if you're gonna use this as a base for your bot.
(Hey you should probably credit me when you use this code)

## What do I need to use this?
Take a look at update-and-exec.sh, it contains commands to install everything for you through pip3. If you just want the package names, look in requirements.txt
#### IF USING AN IDE SUCH AS PYCHARM, YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN. You can figure out how to install everything to the project interpreter online.

### Reminder:
Please don't contact me for issues regarding discord.py, that should be taken to the discord.py server, which has support for both the rewrite and the asyncio (0.16.x) versions.
